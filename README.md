# AMG8833 Sensor Project

Essentially, I am building a simple device to measure the heat signature of my body while asleep, using an AMG8833 IR Thermal Camera from Adafruit. Which will be connected to a Raspberry Pi 5 computer. All in search of patterns within my physical behavior at night while asleep.

I will be collecting this data using Python and JSON, then later visualizing it using D3.js and other JavaScript tools.

This project is currently in the research phase, and the hardware is still being assembled. But enough is known about this experiment making it appropriate to create a new, dedicated project repo.

I will be updating this resource with more information in the near future.
